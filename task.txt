**Submit:**
- Screenshot showing it works
- Your 3 generated outputs

**If Level 1 works → You're ready for Tier 1 tasks**

## Level 1 Help
- Transformers docs: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers
- Pipeline guide: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines

### **LEVEL 2: Experiment & Document** ⭐⭐
*Tests basic Python skills. ~1-2 hours*

**Goal:** Modify the code and observe changes

**Task:**
Expand Level 1 code to:

1. **Save outputs to file** (results.txt)
2. **Try 5 different prompts** (your choice of topics)
3. **Experiment with parameters:**
   - Try `max_length` = 20, 50, 100
   - Try `temperature` = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5
   - Try `top_k` = 10, 50, 100
4. **Time how long generation takes** (use `import time`)
5. **Count tokens** in generated text

**Submit:**
- Your modified code
- results.txt file with outputs
- Brief report:
  - What did changing parameters do?
  - Which settings produced best results?
  - How long did generation take?

**If Level 2 works → You're ready for Tier 2 tasks**

## Level 2 Help
- File I/O in Python: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html
- Timing code: `import time; start = time.time(); ... ; print(time.time() - start)`
- Token counting: Use `len(generator.tokenizer.encode(text))`

---

### **LEVEL 3: Open-Ended Challenge** ⭐⭐⭐
*Tests critical thinking. ~2-3 hours*

**Goal:** Show me HOW you think about problems

**Pick ONE of these challenges:**

---

#### **OPTION A: Break the Model**

**Task:** Find ways to make the model fail or produce bad outputs

Try to make it:
- Repeat itself endlessly
- Generate nonsense/gibberish
- Contradict itself
- Get stuck in loops
- Produce offensive content (document but don't share)
- Any other failure mode

**Submit:**
- At least 5 different failure modes
- Example outputs for each
- Explanation of WHY each failure happens
- Ideas for how to fix it

---

#### **OPTION B: Measure Quality**

**Task:** Create a scoring system for generated text quality

Define "quality" (coherence? creativity? grammar? relevance?) then build code to measure it.

Requirements:
- Score text from 0-100
- Test on at least 10 generated texts
- Show examples of high-scoring vs low-scoring
- Explain: does your metric actually correlate with good text?

**Submit:**
- Your quality metric code
- Scores for 10 texts with explanations
- Reflection: what makes text "high quality"?

---

#### **OPTION C: Compare Models**

**Task:** Test 3+ different models and compare them

Models to try:
- `distilgpt2` (current)
- `gpt2` (larger)
- `gpt2-medium` (even larger)
- Or feel free to find others on Hugging Face

Compare:
- Generation speed
- Output quality (subjective)
- Model size
- When to use each

**Submit:**
- Comparison table (speed, quality, size)
- Same prompts tested on all models
- Recommendation: which model for which use case?

---

#### **OPTION D: Make Your Own Challenge**

If you have a different idea related to text generation, propose it and do it.

**Must include:**
- Clear goal
- Code implementation
- Results/findings
- Analysis

---

**If you complete Level 3 → You're ready for Tier 2-3 tasks**

---

### **LEVEL 4: Freestyle - Build Something New** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
*Tests creativity & initiative. ~3-5 hours*

**Goal:** Show me what YOU can create

**Task:** Build something interesting using what you learned

**Requirements:**
- Must use transformer models (text generation, embeddings, etc.)
- Must be something NEW (not just tutorial code)
- Can be useful, fun, educational, or experimental
- Entirely up to you

**Ideas (don't limit yourself to these):**
- Poetry/story generator with custom style
- Code comment writer
- Meeting notes summarizer
- Text adventure game
- Language learning tool
- Joke generator
- Document Q&A system
- Writing assistant
- Style transfer (formal ↔ casual)
- Sentiment analyzer
- Anything else you dream up

**Submit:**
- What you built (description)
- Why you chose this
- Code + demo (screenshots/video/live link)
- What you learned
- What you'd improve next

**If you complete Level 4 → You're Tier 3 material + might lead your group**
